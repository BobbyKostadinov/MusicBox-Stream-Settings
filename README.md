# MusicBox-Stream-Settings

This repo / file contains my list of radio settings for my MusicBox Raspbery PI home sound system

## Usage

In order to update the URLs for MusicBox there are two options:

1. Edit the streamurl.js file on the microSD card direcly while the deviice is offline 

or 

2. SSH to the Pi then

    cd /boot/config/ 
    nano streamurl.js 
    
  The location of the file might differ.
  After edit, reboot the device
